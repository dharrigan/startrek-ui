== Introduction

This is a very small, yet surprisingly complete, example of using
Clojurescript, Reagent and Semantic UI to present and provide
CRUD-like facilities for a RESTful API.

== Features

* CRUD functionality
* Basic form validation
* A nice little interface using Semantic UI React
* Uses Reagent to handle state (doesn't use re-frame, as this is a very simple example)

== Notes

This is a *very* simple project. It doesn't do anything really fancy,
like using https://github.com/metosin/malli[Malli] to perform real
validation of the data, nor does it try to log in anywhere (i.e., by
doing authentication to the backend). It's just a little Proof Of
Concept and a little demo on using Clojurescript and React.

Also, I'm quite new to Clojurescript, and as such, I'm very *very*
sure my code could be vastly improved (for example, quite a lot of
duplication in the `startrek/modals.cljs` file, however, what is there
is easy to read, so that is good!)

Send me feedback (see below) if you want to talk to me about this
little PoC üòÅ

== Star Trek UI (https://github.com/dharrigan/startrek-ui[this])

The frontend is written using
https://clojurescript.org/[ClojureScript] with a few other bits and
bobs, namely:

* https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs[shadow-cljs]
* https://reagent-project.github.io/[Reagent]
* https://react.semantic-ui.com/[Semantic UI React]
* https://github.com/JulianBirch/cljs-ajax[clj-ajax]

A full list of the technologies used can be found in the
`shadow-cljs.edn` file and the `package.json` file.

== Star Trek Backend (https://github.com/dharrigan/startrek[that])

A companion project used to service the requests can be found on
https://github.com/dharrigan/startrek[github]. Please refer to that
project on details on how that works and how to run it or build it
(for use in this project). üòÄ

== Engage!

There are at least 2 ways to launch this project:

WARNING: Depending on your mode of operation, you *will* require the
backend https://github.com/dharrigan/startrek[startrek] service
running in order for the UI to work! Please review that project for
how to get it up and running. If you are running this UI project using
Option 2 (see below), then you'll need the startrek docker image
available (for that, you will need to build the backend startrek
docker image, using Option 2 of the backend project, i.e., the
`bin/build` step).

IMPORTANT: This has been tested using `node v15.14.0` and `yarn
1.22.10`. No promises for versions other than those! :-)

IMPORTANT: This assumes you have
https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs[shadow cljs] installed
correctly (especially for Option 1 usage, see below)

=== Option 1 - REPL

First install the dependencies using `yarn install`, then fire up the
system using `yarn watch`. This will create a HTTP server listening on
port 9500, a nREPL server and a few other things which you can
discover on the output to the terminal.

NOTE: The port can be overridden by setting the environment variable
`PORT`, i.e., `PORT=9501 yarn watch`

Open up a browser at http://localhost:9500 and, if you have the
backend service running, with luck you should see a list of starships
after the response from the backend has been fetched :-)

=== Option 2 - Full Stack

IMPORTANT: This approach assumes that you have the `startrek` backend
project built as a docker image and is available locally. Please refer
to https://github.com/dharrigan/startrek[that] project for more
details on how to build the docker image.

To run up the entire system, including the frontend, backend and
https://traefik.io/traefik/[Traefik] (for proxying), then simply run
the command:

`bin/run-docker-fullstack`

This will run up everything. Once running successfully, you can open
your browser at http://localhost:9500 to obtain a list of Starships.
